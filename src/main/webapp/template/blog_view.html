                                I had the opportunity to speak at the BUILD 2015 conference in San Francisco with my friend Andrew Connell 
                            and had a great time! We gave a talk on Angular, TypeScript, Azure AD and Office 365 APIs and I also gave two 
                            вЂњExpressвЂќ talks on TypeScript. It was super fun to meet new people and hang out with everyone at the conference. 
                            I even had the opportunity to check out the upcoming HoloLens device which was super cool! I was heading up an 
                            elevator to a meeting and a member of the HoloLens team approached me and asked if I had some time to do some 
                            вЂњHoloLens TestingвЂќ. LetвЂ™s just say that I was a bit late for my meeting вЂ“ I wasnвЂ™t going to pass up the                                         opportunity to check out HoloLens in person.
